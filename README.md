# **Netlify Landing Page – UI Clone**

A front-end portfolio project where I recreated the official Netlify landing page to practice modern UI/UX and animation techniques.

## 🚀 **Live Demo**

👉 _Coming Soon_

## 🧠 **Project Overview**

This project is a **pixel-perfect clone** of Netlify’s landing page, built entirely from scratch to sharpen my skills in **React/Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion**.  
It focuses on **smooth transitions**, **clean layout structure**, and **fully responsive design**, staying true to Netlify’s minimal and modern visual style.

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

-   **Next.js** – for fast, component-based development
-   **Tailwind CSS** – for utility-first styling and responsiveness
-   **Framer Motion** – for fluid animations and micro-interactions
-   **Netlify** – for simple, reliable deployment and hosting

## 🎯 **Purpose**
